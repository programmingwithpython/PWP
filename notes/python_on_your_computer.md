# Installing Python on Your Computer

#### Anaconda

Whether you have a Mac, Windows or Linux system at home, you can get an easy-to-install and highly functional Python environment by installing Continuum Analytic's [Anaconda Package](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
This is the same installation of Python that we have on the computers at BACE.  It has a ton of popular and useful libraries (many of which we won't even touch in this course), it doesn't interfere with your system Python installation, and it also doesn't require admin priviledges for you to use those libraries in your user directories.
