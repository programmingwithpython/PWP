# Programming With Python Repository

This is a repository for the **assignments**, **exercises**, **notes**, and **library functions** that we produce in the Programming With Python course. The **'lib'** folder has the library functions. The **'etc'** folder has notes on our standard setup and the tools we use.  Everything else is grouped by week.  I have some catching up to do with getting the previous weeks up here.  For now, you can find those on the website, http://www.pythonwithalex.com.
